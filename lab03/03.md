# Set interval for sending heartbeats to a very big value

## Installation
```go
// startLeader switches cm into a leader state and begins process of heartbeats.
// Expects cm.mu to be locked.
func (cm *ConsensusModule) startLeader() {
	cm.state = Leader
	cm.dlog("becomes Leader; term=%d, log=%v", cm.currentTerm, cm.log)

	go func() {
		ticker := time.NewTicker(3000 * time.Millisecond)  // <== heartbeat is 3s
		defer ticker.Stop()

		// Send periodic heartbeats, as long as still leader.
		for {
			cm.leaderSendHeartbeats()
			<-ticker.C

			cm.mu.Lock()
			if cm.state != Leader {
				cm.mu.Unlock()
				return
			}
			cm.mu.Unlock()
		}
	}()
}
```
